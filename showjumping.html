<h2>SJ Intermediate Qualifiers - Milton College 6th April 2015</h2>
                <p>Easter Monday dawned bright and sunny for the first running of the intermediate SJ qualifier at the College of West Anglia. Houghton and Huntingdon had one senior team entered for the competition, comprised of Katherine Peden riding Rufus, Danny Harrison riding Wallace, Rebecca Robinson riding Trequite and Nikki Wallace riding Wayward Wanderer. The course was tight and twisty with the first round at 90cm which the team flew meaning we finished the first round on a score of 0! A tougher course of 100cm followed which caused more issues. Unfortunately our first 3 riders each had an unlucky 4 faults, but a fabulous clear from Nikki meant that the team finished on 8 faults gaining a fabulous 3rd place! Everyone had a great day in the sunshine and we had team spirit in abundance if any other members would like to take part in our next summer qualifiers please e-mail me on kas214@hotmail.co.uk.
The Winter Intermediate Team Show Jumping qualifier will be held on Monday 6th April (Easter Monday) at the College of West Anglia, Milton, Cambridge, CB24 6DB.</p>  

</ul> 
<p></p>
<p>The Intermediate Winter Championships will take place on 2nd, 3rd May at Bury Farm Equestrian Village, Slapton, Bucks LU7 9BT

                <h3>Winter Qualifiers - Houghton Hall 2014</h3>
                <p>Huntingdon had the pleasure of hosting the Area Qualifier at Houghton Hall On 15th November 2014.&nbsp; David and Sam did a fab job of organising the event and many compliments were received from participating clubs.</p>
                <p>Huntingdon Juniors were represented by Phoebe Crawford, Abi Guest, Beth Blackman and Georgie Sutton.&nbsp; The girls did a super job and came away with 6th place.&nbsp; The team were hugely grateful to Sam Impey for stepping into the role of SJ Chef for the event</p>
